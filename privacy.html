  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>September 21, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>MemberBot ("we", "us", "our") provides a Discord bot that helps server owners manage member delivery, giveaways, and onboarding. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Discord Identifiers:</strong> Server ID, User ID, and role IDs required for bot functionality and administration.</li>
    <li><strong>Transactional Data:</strong> Purchases, coin balances, pack history, timestamps, and transaction IDs for support and refunds.</li>
    <li><strong>Support Data:</strong> Messages and logs you provide when contacting support (optionally stored to help resolve issues).</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Non-identifying usage metrics (e.g. command counts) to improve the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use collected information to operate the bot (deliver members, process refunds), provide support, secure accounts, and improve the service. We do not sell personal data.</p>

  <h2>Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We may use third-party services for hosting, analytics, or payment processing. Those providers have their own privacy policies — please review them before using paid features.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data as necessary to provide the service and comply with legal obligations. You can request deletion of your data by contacting support.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data by contacting the bot operator via the support server.</p>
